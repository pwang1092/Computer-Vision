# Computer Vision
 my openCV projects
 played around with OpenCV this summer
 some projects to:
 -recognize faces, eyes, etc
 -bounding box around apriltag
 -project markers onto apriltags 
 -used a tensorflow model to recognize faces as well
 -markerPos.py and markPosCube will not work at the moment because it seems that the cv2.aruco.drawDetectedMarkers module has been scrapped. Will update with approprate module when I can
